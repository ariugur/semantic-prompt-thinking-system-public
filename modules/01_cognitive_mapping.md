# Module 01 – Cognitive Mapping

## 🎯 Purpose
To help participants identify their own cognitive style and reflect on how it differs from GPT’s output. This creates the foundation for intentional, self-aware prompting.

> “Before you prompt GPT, you must first understand how you naturally think.”

---

## 🧠 Module Summary
This module does not teach information—it facilitates **self-awareness.**
By comparing their responses with GPT's, participants experience the cognitive gap between human intuition and algorithmic generation.

## 🧭 Steps

### 1. Thought Test: “How Do You Think?”
Participants answer one question in three ways:
- **Factual** (What is it?)
- **Emotional** (How does it feel?)
- **Interpretive** (What would you do?)

**Example Question:**
> “What should I prioritize in my career?”

### 2. GPT Comparison
The same question is entered into GPT.

**Prompt:**
```
What should I prioritize in my career?
```

GPT typically replies:
> “When choosing career priorities, consider your values, strengths, and long-term goals. It's important to align your work with your passions and desired lifestyle.”

### 3. Reflection and Discussion
Participants compare their three responses to GPT’s single output.
- Where does GPT sound helpful, but generic?
- Where is your personal reasoning more nuanced?
- Did GPT mirror your tone, or flatten it?

---

## 💬 Instructor Notes
- Emphasize: GPT is not “wrong” — it's just different.
- Participants must **observe their own thinking** to start designing resonant prompts.
- This activity breaks the illusion of GPT being “smart” and reframes it as “structured.”

---

## 🧩 Learning Outcome
By the end of this module, participants should be able to:
- Articulate their own reasoning patterns
- Recognize the contrast between human cognition and GPT formulation
- Approach future prompts with more intent and self-reflection

> The quality of your prompt begins with the clarity of your thinking.”
